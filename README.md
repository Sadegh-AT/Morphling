Just toss him a pic, and he'll pop it up in the terminal for you!

But hey, keep an eye on these couple of things:

❕ Your pic shouldn't go beyond 100x100.

❕ Keep it easy with basic colors like red, blue, and green in your pic, it'll turn out better that way!

#### Just slap in your pic's address, like so:

```js
const imagePath = "./default.png";
```
